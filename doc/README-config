When the system is powered on it displays a configuration dialog,
that allows to setup and run the machine, either with standalone
software, or boot an operating system from floppy disk. The dialog
is very ineloquent and there is no builtin help, because of the
limited memory resources of the Arduino Nano's ATmega328 MCU. So
here a short introduction how to use it, the dialog looks like this:

	Z80-SIM v1.6

	1 - port 255: 0x22
	2 - load file
	3 - Disk 0:
	4 - Disk 1:
	5 - run machine

	Command:

To select a configuration option enter the number at the prompt.

With 1 the value read from port 255 can be set. This is the hardware
configuration that sofware can query, which components are in the
machine. MITS Altair BASIC interpreter versions < 4.0 need a value
of 0x00 and versions >= 4.0 a value of 0x22. To set the value enter
two hex digits, not just one and return. If you want to set it to
0x07 then enter 07.

With 2 one can load a file with 8080/Z80 binary code into the memory.
Just enter the name of the file, directory and extension will be added
by the software. Unfortunately we cannot list directory contents because
of the memory constrains, so keep directory listings on the PC you used
to prepare the MicroSD card.

With 3 one can mount/unmount disk images on disk drive 0. To mount
one enter the filename, to unmount enter return only. If disk drive 0
has a disk image mounted the machine will boot from this, no matter
which program code was loaded before. A disk image in disk drive 0
must contain a bootable operating system, like the included CP/M 2.2
implementation for the machine.

With 4 one can mount/unmount another disk image with some application
software or data or whatever, same as with drive 0.

With 5 the 8080/Z80 CPU is started with code from disk drive 0, and
if nothing mounted with whatever was loaded into the memory.
